# Absenteeism_Prediction

i.  This Machine Learning project is developed to predict Absenteeism of Employee based on certain characteristics provided to us through data

ii.  Analyzed past absenteeism data of employees and Designed logistic regression model, to predict whether that employee will be absent for more than 3 hours, the 3 hour cap is based on average employee absenteeism throughout the organisation, we then used those predictions visualize the prediction data by comparing it with several important characteristics of our data using Tableau.

iii.  Our output is split in two classes one is "Moderately absent" which equates to "0" & other is "Excessively absent" which equates to "1". and then visualize that data using Tableau, so that, we can get insights on our predictions.

iv.  The predictions made are based on certain employee characteristics and behaviour patterns This information will help us solve various problems the employee might be facing, which is reflecting poorly through their time away during working hours, so that we can try andh help them as much as we can from the organisation, and improve the work environment, So better working environment would result in better output from employees, and we can improve our productivity throughout the organisation.


Key Achievements: Developed a Logistic Regression model with test accuracy of 0.73
